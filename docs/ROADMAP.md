# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development phases for our project, including important milestones, features, and improvements we aim to achieve.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Development

**Objective**: Set up the project, create a basic React application, and establish a solid foundation.

- [x] Initialize the project with Vite.
- [x] Create the project's folder structure.
- [x] Set up a basic React application.
- [x] Define the project's styling approach (CSS modules, styled-components, etc.).
- [x] Implement a basic navigation system.
- [x] Create initial documentation (README.md).
- [x] Implement a landing page with essential components.

## Phase 2: Testing Implementation

**Objective**: Ensure code quality and reliability through testing suites.

- [ ] Choose a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components.
- [ ] Implement end-to-end (E2E) testing with appropriate tools (e.g., Cypress).
- [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) for automated testing.
- [ ] Create a comprehensive testing documentation (TESTING.md).

## Phase 3: Feature Development

**Objective**: Add new features and functionality to the project.

- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Develop additional pages and components as per project requirements.
- [ ] Integrate data fetching and management (API calls, state management).
- [ ] Enhance user experience with animations and transitions.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Phase 4: Transition to TypeScript

**Objective**: Improve code maintainability and catch type-related errors early.

- [ ] Migrate existing JavaScript code to TypeScript.
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configurations (tsconfig.json).
- [ ] Update type definitions for third-party libraries used.
- [ ] Implement TypeScript in new feature development.
- [ ] Document TypeScript best practices and guidelines (TYPING_GUIDELINES.md).

## Phase 5: Optimization and Performance

**Objective**: Enhance project performance, optimize code, and address potential bottlenecks.

- [ ] Conduct performance audits using tools like Lighthouse.
- [ ] Optimize assets, images, and code splitting.
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-essential resources.
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical rendering paths.
- [ ] Ensure accessibility and follow best practices.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Objective**: Rigorously test the project's features and functionality.

- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
- [ ] Conduct cross-browser and cross-platform testing.
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling scenarios.
- [ ] Address and fix any identified issues or bugs.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

**Objective**: Prepare the project for production deployment and provide comprehensive documentation.

- [ ] Write detailed API documentation (API.md).
- [ ] Create user guides and tutorials for end-users.
- [ ] Generate a comprehensive project documentation (DOCS.md).
- [ ] Set up production-ready configurations (environment variables, error tracking).
- [ ] Deploy the project to a production server.
- [ ] Monitor the live application and implement logging.

## Phase 8: Release and Maintenance

**Objective**: Plan for ongoing maintenance.

- [ ] Collect user feedback and feature requests.
- [ ] Plan for regular updates and bug fixes.
- [ ] Consider long-term maintenance and support.
